        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element is not displayed to the user of the webpage except for the page title which appears in the browser's title bar.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The body element is an exmple of a semantic HTML element. In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Headings and paragraphs can be added with h1 through h6 for headings and p and /p for paragraphs.</li>
          <li> ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists. </li>
          <li>img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. With src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image. </li>
          <li>br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. href attribute points to the URL for the link </li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets  is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users</li>
          <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options</li>
          <li>external CSS style sheet is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
          <li>internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

          <li>In coding parlance, a variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Just like its name sounds, when using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true. </li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. </li>
